             <p class="about-paragraph"> In addition to my work that is intended for an academic audience, I conduct applied research addressing specific community or regional needs. My areas of emphasis include <strong>regional and community economic strategy development, industry cluster analyses, socio-economic impact studies, and policy analysis</strong>.  I have also given more than 100 presentations, including my <strong>"By the Numbers" </strong>series that help community leaders, policy makers and other local stakeholders understand how their region is changing and what these changes might mean for the future. Several recent studies and presentations are shared below. Each of these analyses include the use of GIS in a variety of applications.
