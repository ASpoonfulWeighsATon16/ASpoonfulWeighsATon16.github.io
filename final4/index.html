        <h2>Wisconsin is Facing a Tight Labor Market...</h2>
           
        <h5><p>Business owners, elected officials and educational institutions are increasingly feeling the effects of a labor market that is growing older and shrinking in size. While historically low unemployment rates, and the arrival of Foxconn in Southeast Wisconsin, have placed a greater focus on current labor market conditions, economists have raised warnings about these changes for decades.  
     
        <p>The <a class = a-topunder  href = "http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/workers-wanted-wisconsin-s-looming-crisis/collection_1e27dc95-df35-54c1-a0e6-cfb4780db7cf.html" target="_blank">"Workers Wanted" </a> series in the <i>Wisconsin State Journal</i> provides one overview of the reasons behind Wisconsin's tight labor market. However, the maps contained in this resource further depict some of the dramatic changes to Wisconsin's labor force over the past 15 years.  Several maps also consider what the future may hold.</p>
